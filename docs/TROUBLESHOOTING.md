# When it goes wrong

## Rule 1

If the unit failed after "unbind", do not touch bind/unbind by hand. Reboot.
A faulted nouveau teardown leaves the device lock held; a second write hangs in D state
and cannot be killed.

The one exception: a failure in the Gen3 stage (before any nouveau bind) leaves the card
unbound but healthy. Since 1.1.0 the script clears `driver_override` on the way out, so
`echo <bdf> > /sys/bus/pci/drivers/nvidia/bind` is safe there.

## Messages

`journalctl -u cmp100-unlock -b` and `/var/log/cmp100-unlock/run-*.log` have the trace.

| message | cause | fix |
|---|---|---|
| `a previous run did not finish (marker ...)` | last boot's run hung or crashed | read that boot's log, then `cmp100-unlock --force` or `rm /var/lib/cmp100-unlock/in-progress` |
| `must start bound to nvidia (is: '')` | nvidia not loaded/probed yet; the script waits 30 s and tries modprobe/bind itself | if persistent, check `dmesg \| grep NVRM` and Secure Boot |
| `Tensor baseline 0xffffffff` / `BAR0 not decoding after reset` | BAR0 not decoding | bad riser/slot; the script already forces COMMAND mem+master after every unbind and reset |
| `active ... is neither stock nor a known payload` | linux-firmware updated to an untested revision | rerun install.sh; if the hashes in tools/build_payloads.py don't match your files, open an issue with sha256s |
| `hook built for ...` | kernel upgraded | `sudo ./install.sh` |
| `X.service is active; a DRM client...` | desktop up during a manual run | run at boot, or stop the DM |
| `has OPT_PCIE_BOOT_GEN23/GEN3_DISABLE fused` | this card's Gen2/Gen3 disable fuses are blown (both read 0 on our `1df4` cards) | the clamp clear cannot help; `cmp100-unlock --gen2` or `CMP100_PCIE=2` in the config |
| `upstream port ... only supports GenN` | the slot/switch above the card is not Gen3-capable | move the card, or use `--gen2` |
| `did not train to Gen3 (LnkSta GenN)` | clamp cleared and target set, but the link would not retrain at 8 GT/s: Gen2-only riser, BIOS slot speed limit, or a marginal cable | `lspci -vv -s <upstream> \| grep -E 'LnkCap\|LnkCtl2\|LnkSta'`; try another riser; `--gen2` still works. Nothing else was touched: the card is simply rebound |
| `link is GenN after Tensor stage; falling back to signed Gen2 path` | the nouveau/nvidia POST downshifted the link on this slot (not seen here) | not an error; the Gen2 stage runs automatically for that card |
| `did not reach Gen2 after 3 attempts` | root port capped at Gen1 by BIOS, or a Gen1-only riser | `lspci -vv -s <upstream> \| grep -E 'LnkCap\|LnkCtl2'`; Tensor stays unlocked regardless |
| `produced no BOOT_RETURN` | nouveau never reached ACR load | `dmesg \| grep -E 'nouveau\|gv100'` |
| `No such device` on a manual `echo <bdf> > .../drivers/nvidia/bind` | stale `driver_override` from an interrupted run | `echo '' > /sys/bus/pci/devices/<bdf>/driver_override`, then bind again |

## Readings that look wrong but are not

`nvidia-smi --query-gpu=pcie.link.gen.current` says **2** (or 1) after a Gen3 run, and
`lspci -vv -s <bdf>` says `LnkSta: Speed 8GT/s (strange), Width x1 (ok)`. Both are the
same effect: the NVIDIA driver's devinit re-clamps the *advertised* capability to Gen1/2
but leaves the trained link alone. nvidia-smi reports the cap; lspci reports the link and
flags the mismatch as "strange". Trust `lspci` LnkSta, `cat
/sys/bus/pci/devices/<bdf>/current_link_speed` (`8.0 GT/s PCIe`), `cmp100-unlock status`
(prints both with a note), or `cmp100-pcie-bw` (~0.8 GB/s per direction on x1 Gen3 vs
~0.2 on Gen1). See docs/REGISTERS.md, "The Gen1 clamp".

## Disabling

Disable without uninstalling: add `cmp100.skip` to the kernel command line, or
`systemctl disable cmp100-unlock`. Tensor-only: `CMP100_PCIE=0` in `/etc/cmp100-unlock.conf`
or `cmp100-unlock --no-pcie`.
